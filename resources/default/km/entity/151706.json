      "description": "Written by American journalist and playwright Sophie Treadwell, MACHINAL is coming to the Old Vic for a limited run this year.\nRosie Sheehy (Oleanna, Chernobyl) reprises her critically acclaimed role in Olivier Award-winning director Richard Jones’ ‘outstanding production’ (Daily Mail).\nInspired by the true story of the convicted and subsequently executed murderer Ruth Snyder, MACHINAL is widely considered to be one of the high points of expressionist theatre. Directed by Arthur Hopkins for its Broadway premiere in 1928, the two-part play was notable for being the first Broadway performance of Clark Gable.\nThe play was first performed in Britain under the name The Life Machine in 1931, with more productions following under the original name after that, including a Royal National Theatre production in 1994 which won three Olivier Awards, and the most recent production at the Almeida Theatre in 2018, directed by Natalie Abrahami.\nThe cast of MACHINAL will also include: Daniel Abelson, Sam Alexander, Steven Beard, Daniel Bowerbank, Imogen Daines, Buffy Davis, Tim Frances, Carla Harrison-Hodge, Emilio Iannucci, Pierro Niel-Mee and Wendy Nottingham, with further casting to be announced.\nBook your MACHINAL theatre tickets with LOVEtheatre today!",
