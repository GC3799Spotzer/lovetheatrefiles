      "description": "Nominated for the WhatsOnStage Awards 2024 for Best Takeover Performance\nTina Turner was one of the greatest musical artists the world has ever seen. From humble beginnings in Nutbush, Tennessee, to her triumphant transformation against all odds into the global Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll, Tina Turner didn’t just break the rules, she rewrote them!\nSet to the pulse-pounding soundtrack of her much-loved hits, TINA – THE TINA TURNER MUSICAL at the Aldwych Theatre is an exhilarating celebration of the artist we know and love. Now celebrating five years in the West End and presented in association with Tina Turner herself, this smash hit musical is written by Olivier Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Katori Hall and directed by the internationally acclaimed Phyllida Lloyd.\nDuring her incredible life, Tina Turner won 12 Grammy Awards and her live shows were seen by millions, selling more concert tickets than any other solo performer in music history.\nBook your TINA – THE TINA TURNER MUSICAL theatre tickets with LOVEtheatre today!",
