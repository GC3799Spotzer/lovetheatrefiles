      "description": "Seven-time BAFTA Award winner Steve Coogan stars in the first ever adaption of Stanley Kubrick’s black comedy DR. STRANGELOVE, as the world premiere stage production prepares for a strictly limited run at London’s Noël Coward Theatre from 8 October 2024.\nThis comedy masterpiece, about a rogue U.S. General who triggers a nuclear crisis, is brought to the stage by acclaimed, BAFTA and Emmy Award winner Armando Iannucci and Olivier Award winner Sean Foley, in an explosively funny satire of mutually assured destruction. Kubrick‘s iconic movie Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, based on the book Red Alert by Peter George, starred Peter Sellers, George C Scott and Sterling Hayden, while this brand new production will star Steve Coogan in multiple roles!\nCoogan said: “The idea of putting Dr Strangelove on stage is daunting. A huge responsibility. It’s also an exciting challenge, an opportunity to bring this timeless classic to a new audience. Knowing that I will be part of a creative team led by Sean Foley and Armando Iannucci means I will be working with the best people. Sean is a master of stage comedy and Armando and I started working with each other over 30 years ago. We made some memorable comedy together so it’s great to be collaborating with him once again.”\nBook your DR. STRANGELOVE theatre tickets with LOVEtheatre today!",
