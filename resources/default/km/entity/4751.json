    "c_answer2": "The Book of Mormon follows the story of two Mormon missionaries, Elder Price and Elder Cunningham, working to spread the word of the Latter Day Saints to the locals in a small town in Uganda. The pair realise how daunting their task is when they are immediately robbed at gunpoint by a local warlord as soon as they arrive. They soon discover the villagers are more concerned with the AIDS epidemic, oppression, and starvation to care about their preaching. The young evangelists wrestle with their own integrity and beliefs, coming together to find that they both rely on each other in very similar ways.",
