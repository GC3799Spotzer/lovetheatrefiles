      "description": "Having played at the Leicester Curve in summer 2023, KISS ME, KATE is transferring to the Barbican Theatre for a limited 15 week run in summer 2024!\nFrom the Producer of hit musical Anything Goes, also at the Barbican, comes a new production of Cole Porter’s KISS ME, KATE, starring the multi-award-winner Adrian Dunbar (Ridley, Line of Duty) and Broadway Royalty and Tony Award Winner Stephanie J. Block (Into The Woods, The Cher Show, 9 to 5) making her West End debut. The pair are joined by Olivier nominee Charlie Stemp (Crazy For You, Mary Poppins), rising star Georgina Onuorah (The Wizard of Oz, Oklahoma), Nigel Lindsay (Victoria, Shrek The Musical) and Hammed Animashaun (A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Black Ops).\nThis new production is directed by Bartlett Sher (The King and I, South Pacific and To Kill A Mockingbird) and choreographed by Anthony Van Laast (Mamma Mia!, Sister Act, Hair). With a company of over 50 including a full-scale orchestra and featuring Cole Porter classics such as Another Op’nin’, Another Show, Brush Up Your Shakespeare and Tom, Dick or Harry, KISS ME, KATE is the perfect Summer musical for 2024.\nKISS ME, KATE is the original farce and whisks you into a world of backstage chaos and romantic entanglements. With Cole Porter’s razor-sharp wit, it’s ‘The ultimate Broadway musical from the golden age’ (Financial Times) and is Broadway musical comedy meets Shakespeare meets Noises Off.\nBook your KISS ME, KATE theatre tickets with LOVEtheatre today!",
